# CS5262-50 Project

# Project Metrics

### Background

Just for a quick summary, our goal of our ML model is to predict whether or not, using a specific trading strategy, we will make money from the stock market or not. The trading strategy we will focus on initially will be to simply buy a stock at the end of one day and sell it the next. This will drastically limit the scope in which we have to research and refine our  model. Additionally, since we can only buy/sell a single stock with our model, we will define a spread of money we are willing to invest across multiple stocks, this will simulate diversifying our portfolio to limit outlier days where either some extraordinary social, political, or economic event happens that greatly affects the stock price. 

We will define some terms that we will use for the rest of this project for clarity:

* Purchase Close Event (PCE): This refers to the event of buying stock at close of a particular day. 
* Sell Close Event (SCE): This refers to the event of selling a stock at the close of a particular day. 
* Trade Window: The amount of time (we'll measure in days, initially) between a purchase event and a sell event.

### Metrics

The metrics for success and failure, are rather quite simple, since unlike other problems such as creating a ML model for the prediction of whether or not someone is sick or not, do not require additional research into the penantly for getting the prediction wrong. 

The main goal of this project is to simply make more money from the stock market than that of a trading algorithm that randomly selects whether or not initiate a purchase close event on day 1 and a sell close event on day 2. Its Important to note here that our trade window will be static at 1 day, at least initially. 

Furthermore, we will define a static amount of money we will invest over different stocks to simulate diversity. Lastly, although not as important, we will define a static amount of total money invested, that will be spread across all stocks. Although static, it would be important to note this as a variable as some algorithmic trading strategies do not work at scale. 

We'll define total amount initial amount invested as: 

$$
T_0
$$

 Well define the amount invested in each stock, at a time $i$ to be:

$$
SI_{x,i} = {T_i \over |S_x|}
$$

Where $S_x$ is the collection of the growth rate of the stocks we are focsing on and $|S_x|$ is the cardinality of $S_x$, the number of stocks we will invest in. $T_i$ is the amount of money that we have at a time $i$. 

Next, we'll want to define an terms and expressions to show the amount of money we made/loss starting at an initial day $i$.
$$
T_{i+1} = \sum_{x=X} (P_{x,i} + 1)(SI_{x,i}) + \sum_{w=W} (1.00)(SI_{w,i}) = PL_{sum} + NT_{sum}
$$

Where {$P_{x,i}$ |  -1 <= x <= 1 at a time $i$} and are the percentage changes from the beginning and end of the trade window at a time $i$. $SI_{x,i}$ is the amount of money invested in that particular stock at a time $i$. X will be the set of indices of the stock that we chose to invest, while W will be the stock that we chose not to invest.

The first summation will be all stocks that we chose to invest, while the second summation are the stocks that we chose not to invest (therefore did not lose money or gain money). We'll call these two summations $PL_{sum}$ for profit loss, and $NT_{sum}$ for no trade. 

So for a group of trades, we can define it our ending amount with profits/losses over a time period $n$ as: 

$$
T_{end} = T_0 + \sum_{i=0}^n(\sum_{x=X} (P_{x,i} + 1)(SI_{x,i}) + \sum_{w=W} (1.00)(SI_{w,i}))
$$

This can be used for both our model and our random algorithm. 

Let $TM_{end}$ be the end amount we get from our ML model, and $TR_{end}$ be the end amount we get from our randomized algorithm.

If,

$$
	TM_{end} > (TR_{end})(Îµ) 
$$
For some arbitrary small $\epsilon$ 
Then we have shown that our model has outperformed our random algorithm by a factor of $\epsilon$. But we must also confirm: 

$$
	TM_{end} > T_0
$$

To show that the money we end up with after trading is greater than not trading at all.


## Confusion Matrix

#### False Positives
In stock trading, a false positive would mean that our trading model advised us to invest but it shouldnt have. This outcome is worst than a false negative, since there is not a floor to how much money we could lose. In theory, when we sell our stock, the stock could have crashed to $0, or lost %100 of its value. 

Its pertinent for our model that we air on the side of caution and bias our model to not invest if there is not a strong indication that the stock will go up. By not investing, we guarantee that we keep that money instead of losing it all.

One factor we must also consider is the compounding nature of profit and losses. For each profit we make on a day, we are able to invest even more the following day. However, as stated earlier, there is huge potential for losses if the stock crashes that day. So these two factors must be weighed and considered.

#### False Negatives
Although not as volatile as a false positives, we ideally want to ensure that we are choosing to invest on some days, even if they are few.  We are comfortable with choosing to invest fewer days rather than more since we want to minimize the amount of false positives that we get. Furthermore, unlike false positives, false negatives would still allow us to trade in the future since the amount of money we have has not been depleted. Conversely, false positives will quickly drain our amount of money we have to invest, and if we get to zero, we are no longer able to invest.

## Conclusion

We have demonstrated the mathematical expressions that we will use to as metrics for our ML model, as well as how we plan on using these metrics to determine success/failure, and finally, we have shown the impacts to the business of false negatives and false positives and how we plan on prioritizing both.
